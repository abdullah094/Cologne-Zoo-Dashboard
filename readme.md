# Dashboard-Cologne-Zoo
> This is the overview board of the Cologne Zoo. It can be used by zookeepers to get an overview of the animals and their relevant health data.

## Technologies used
* TypeScript
* Vue3/Nuxt3
* Tailwind
* Faker
* husky

## Features
* Display of all the animals of the zoo by their Specie, Gender, Age and Weight, Required Food

## Setup
* Run "npm install"
* Run "npm run dev" to start the server
* Open "http://localhost:3000/" in the browser

### Step 8 
## Future Plans
* We need a new feeding table sorted by date so that the zoo keeper can plan his feeding ahead of time.
* We need to add more features like cleaning the animal table and cleaning the cage table.
* We need more APIs with more requirements for that like the size of the cage and the cleaning supplies that needs to be used for that specific animal.
